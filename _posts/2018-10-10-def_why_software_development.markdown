How did I get here?  I really think I would have to attribute my current path into software development to an afterwork happy hour - the type of happy hour where you drink and then say all your feelings.  I wasn't too happy with my work situation and I just really needed a change.  I was having a lot of WHAT IF thoughts and the one thought that kept coming up was - What if I got a Computer Engineering degree instead of my Mass Communications degree?  

I went to the USF and UCF years ago.  I wasn't sure about what I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing and dabbled in a few different fields - one being Computer Engineering.  At that time the bright lights of the entertainment business was calling my name.  I wanted to work in TV, with celebrities, maybe be on camera or producing behind-the-scenes.  I interned at a few different TV outlets in the area and got a job immediately at HSN (Home Shopping Network) where I spent the last 11 YEARS!  I had many roles and got to meet some amazing people - Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez, Wolfgang Puck, Cyndi Lauper, Tyra Banks and more - pretty much everyone had some kind of tie with HSN.  The company was purchased and the situation at work was a a bit shaky.

Realizing what I really wanted to do during that happy hour, I researched my best school options.  Going back to USF was going to take a long time and be too costly.  Flatiron School was recommended and seems like the best option!   

I want to learn software development, because it's interesting!  I want to use my brain more and create!  The tech community is continuously growing and changing.  There is an abundance of tech jobs in all lines of work.  Also some of the best people I know are software developers - my husband and my grandpa.  They have been super supportive of my decision.  My name is Alisa Cookie McCormick and I've very excited to this new chapter of life.
