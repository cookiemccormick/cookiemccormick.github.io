I've decided to build myself a portfolio website.  It was suggested by the career coach so I can share my resume, the web applications I've created, as well as my resume, and most importantly showcase my skills in creating a website.  

## Browse other websites
My first step was to browse other people's websites.  How are they structured?  What are my likes and dislikes?  I want to keep it simple, readable and clean.  

I've noted a few things that I need to include:
* An about me section - education, past work experience, and some fun things about me
* Downloadable resume
* Contact information and a link that opens up an email
* Web applications

## Purchase domain name
Next I needed to purchase a domain name.  I was lucky enough that alisacookiemccormick.com was not taken.  Be sure to check that website in the future.  There is nothing to see currently.  I may make a coming soon view.

## Creating the website
I explored some options on how I should create my website.  I started with GitHub pages and pivoted to using React.  I really liked working with React with my last project and wanted to continue to play around with it.  I like that it is component-based, so I'll have a different component for each of the sections.  

## Layout
For this I browsed more websites, but also template websites to see what I thought looked clean such as Squarespace.  What kind of cool effects do I want to have, without making it look too busy like a MySpace page.  What is a good set of complimenting colors?  Dark mode or light mode?  

I am a person who leans more towards light mode.  As for color palette, I find inspiration through Color Palette Cinema's instagram page.  They take a shot from a movie and select the colors from scene to make the palette.  It's beautiful!
